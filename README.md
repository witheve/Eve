## Disclaimer

Eve is currently at a very early, "pre-alpha" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development.

As always, with pre-release software, don’t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we’re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we’ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.
