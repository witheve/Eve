# Bugs

When filing a bug on GitHub, please help us help you by including the following:

* *Steps to reproduce the bug.*
* Include a gist of the database in the issue (You can use the settings gear at the bottom, open the save panel, and hit the `save to gist` button to do this magically).
* Your operating system and Eve version.

Note: The issue tracker is mainly for bugs. Questions should be asked on the [Eve Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk).

# Feature Requests

For now, we'll be tracking feature requests in Github issues as well, so feel free to tell us what you think is missing or things you wish you had!

## Code Contributions
_By contributing code to Eve, you are agreeing to release it under the Apache 2.0 License._

If it's your first time contributing, we'd love to have you :). Eve is moving fast though, so before contributing make sure to talk to us so that we can help guide you in the right direction and prevent you from working on something that we might be switching gears on.

When contributing:

* [Check out issues](https://github.com/Kodowa/Eve/labels/beginner) that are ready to be worked on. Feel free to ping a contributor if you need help along the way.
* For any other contributions, please discuss with us as early as possible. We want your hard work to count.
* We are not currently seeking refactoring contributions or code convention tweaks e.g. whitespace. This may change at a later point when we have automated tests and an explicit code convention.
