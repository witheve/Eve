It's a child of the [roots build system](http://github.com/jenius/roots), but is totally old enough to live on it's own. It can be integrated as a plugin for stylus or included manually.\n\n**Detailed documentation for axis [can be found here!](http://roots.cx/axis)**\n\n## Usage\n\nAxis is already integrated into [roots](http://roots.cx) by default, and it's super easy to use it there. Definitely the easiest way if you are setting up a project that uses stylus anyway, and it comes with jade and coffeescript ready out of the box as well. However, if you do want to include manually in your own pipeline, here's how to make it happen with connect (or express):\n\n```js\nvar connect = require('connect')\n  , stylus = require('stylus')\n  , axis = require('axis-css');\n\nvar server = connect();\n\nfunction compile(str, path) {\n  return stylus(str)\n    .set('filename', path)\n    .use(axis());\n}\n\nserver.use(stylus.middleware({\n    src: __dirname\n  , compile: compile\n}));\n```\n\nBy default, axis' mixins will be included automatically into all parsed stylesheets when included as above. If you'd like to import axis manually in stylus when you want to use it, you can pass `{ implicit: false }` to the axis call, as such:\n\n```js\nfunction compile(str, path) {\n  return stylus(str)\n    .set('filename', path)\n    .use(axis({implicit: false}));\n}\n```\n\nIf you do it this way, you'll need to `@import` axis manually wherever you'd like access to the mixins, as such:\n\n```styl\n@import 'axis'\n\nnormalize()\nbase()\n...etc...\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
