  "Tutorial": "; This is a wireframe version of a textual editor for Eve. Ultimately, \n; this is unlikely to be how people interact with the system, but it \n; gives us an opportunity to work with the language before the real \n; workflow has fully come together and test the language in fun and \n; interesting ways.\n\n; Eve is based on datalog, but you can think of it more as a non-crappy \n; SQL. As such, the operations you have available to you look and feel \n; like relational algebra. As a matter of fact, everything in Eve is \n; just a view over some inputs. Let's see how we define a view:\n\n* user\n  ~ name age\n  + \"Chris\" 27\n  \n; The * denotes a new view. The symbol that follows it is its name. \n; You'll also notice that there's a table card on the right. Based on\n; that card, you can see that the first is defining the headers of \n; the view, the second adds a single row with the name \"Chris\" and the \n; age 27. Let's see how we use that information in another view to \n; calculate when I was born by uncommenting the code below:\n\n;* yearBorn\n;  | user age\n;  born = 2014 - @age\n\n; Here we've defined \"yearBorn\", which selects the age from the \"user\" \n; view and then calculates a new column called \"born\". Everything after\n; an equals sign is a javascript function right, so in order to \n; denote the we want the value of the age column, not some random\n; bit of js, we precede the symbol with an @. This allows you to do\n; the equivalent of formulas in Excel.\n\n; Also like Excel, everything in Eve is live - this is one of the \n; benefits we get from everything being a view. Try adding a new name \n; and age to the user view and see what happens. You'll see that all \n; the views update and now have multiple rows. But right now, our\n; information is in two different tables. Let's see how we can join \n; the yearBorn and user view together:\n\n;* userBorn\n;  | user name age\n;  | yearBorn age born\n  \n; Joins are implicit in Eve, which means columns referenced with the same\n; symbol are joined automatically. To have greater control over this, you \n; can alias fields by doing column:alias like so:\n\n;* userBornAlias\n;  | user name age:a\n;  | yearBorn age:a born:birthYear\n  \n; You can also filter your views by a value using column=value:\n\n;* peopleAged27\n;  | user name age=27\n\n; Only being able to filter by constants would be fairly limiting though, \n; so you can also filter via a javascript function that returns true or \n; false using the ? operator:\n\n;* peopleOlderThan 25\n;  | user name age\n;  ? @age > 25\n\n; So that lets us do the standard relational operations, but we're missing\n; a way to calculate over a set of rows (e.g. to sum something or take\n; the average). For example, let's see how we would calculate the average \n; age of our users:\n\n;* averageAge\n;  > user | age = avg(@user.age)\n  \n; The > denotes that we're doing an aggregation, taking lots of rows and \n; turning them into a single value. We name that value \"age\" in this case \n; and set it equal to a function that takes the average of the age column\n; in the user table. Note that if we had used @age instead of @user.age \n; it would mean the age field in the current view as opposed to the \n; age field in the table we're aggregating over.\n\n; One other thing we added syntax for is UI since it's pretty common in \n; applications. We represent HTML as nested lists denoted by\n; enclosing brackets like so:\n\n;* drawUsers\n;  | user name age\n;  [\"p\" {\"id\" name} name \" is \" age \" years old.\"]\n\n; You'll note at the top of our stack of cards that a UI card has now \n; appeared and that there are lines for each user in the user table. \n; In order to get a line per user, we needed to make each paragraph \n; unique by giving it an id as Eve has set semantics. The second element \n; of a UI list can be a map of attributes. The first is the type of HTML \n; tag and everything else is interpreted as a child. You can nest these \n; lists to your heart's content.\n  \n; And that's more or less it. The entire language is just stringing these\n; views together in interesting ways. Checkout the various examples to get\n; a feel for how these things start to come together and see some more\n; advanced notions like views that have multiple contributors (which\n; allows you to do recursion).\n  ",
